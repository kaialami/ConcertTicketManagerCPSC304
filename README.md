# Ticket and Concert managing application (Showtime!)
### CPSC 304 Project  
by Kai Alami & Huxley Bragg & Callie Mays  

## Summary
Our project aims to be a way for people interested in seeing bands perform to find performances that they would like to buy tickets for. For example, if someone is a fan of some band, they can use this application to look up upcoming shows by the band, including information about venue, setlist, band members, whether the show is a part of some event, etc. It also allows for potential performers to publish upcoming shows for concert goers to buy tickets for.  

Our application has two modes that users can sign in as: ConcertGoer or Band. ConcertGoers are customers interested in buying tickets for shows and Bands are performers interested in listing shows and tickets for purchase.
