# Ticket and Concert managing application
### CPSC 304 Project  
by Kai Alami & Huxley Bragg & Callie Mays  

## Summary
Our project aims to be a way for people interested in seeing bands perform to find performances that they would like to buy tickets for. For example, if someone is a fan of some band, they can use this application to look up upcoming shows by the band, including information about venue, setlist, band members, whether the show is a part of some event, etc. It also allows for potential performers to publish upcoming shows for concert goers to buy tickets for.
